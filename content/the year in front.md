I particularly like this as it counters my 'looked back at the scorched earth of another year just gone' propensity. 

>  In Aymara, _nayra_, or last year, translates literally to something like “the year I can see.” The past, visible, thus stands in front of the speaker, while the future, unseeable, looms behind. _Ancha nayra pachana_, or a long time ago, can roughly be translated as “a time way in front of me.”
