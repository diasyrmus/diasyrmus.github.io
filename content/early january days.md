Today, like yesterday, is bright as a pin. Temperatures hovering around freezing. Hair freshly shorn, and an hour or so of French homework in front of me. I really need to polish up on my verb conjugations.

It's still a delight to be at home, doing very little indeed. Though my brothers (both of them! when was the last time that happened!) will be round later.
